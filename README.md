# Website
The Source Code for my Website. It uses Svelte for the GUI and Rocket for the back-end server.

# Developing
## Prerequists
* Rust: Install it at [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/)
* Node.js: Install it at [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) or [via a package manager](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)

## Downloading
1. Clone the repo via `git clone https://github.com/Stridsvagn69420/Homepage`
2. Move into the directory with `cd Homepage`
3. Install every dependency with `npm install` and `cargo fetch`

## Tooling
* `make run` or `npm run dev`: Compiles the Rust and Svelte code and launches the server.
* `make` or `npm run build`: Just compiles Svelte.
* `make start` or `npm start`: Just (compiles and) starts the server.
* `make check` or `npm run check`: Checks the Svelte code for any issues.
